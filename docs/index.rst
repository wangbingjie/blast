Blast is developed on `github <https://github.com/astrophpeter/blast>`_.

Blast is a public web application built to find a transinet's host
galaxy, identify the available archival data, and measure the resulting
host galaxy star formation rates, masses, and stellar ages - for every
new transient reported to the IAU in real-time after the transient is
announced. This information is not provided by any existing transient
broker service.

Blast is currently developed by the `UCSC Transients Team <https://transients.ucsc.edu/>`_.
